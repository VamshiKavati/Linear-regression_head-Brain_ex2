Linear Regression using sklearn
 
We are here to check the linear Regression using sklearn

Import sklearn and Pandas

Read the data from Head brain csv file

assingn the values to x and y as dependent and independent values

Creating Instance for linear Regression and fit the value on the test cases

Predict the value with help of predict sklear

Plotting Scatter Points and Regression Line 

Now check the score the r2 value to know the goodness of fit line
